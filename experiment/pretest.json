          "a":"The XNOR gate outputs a logical 1 when the number of input 1's is even, making it suitable for generating odd parity rather than even parity.",
          "b":"An XOR gate outputs a logical 1 when the number of input 1's is odd. By using an XOR gate with all the bits of a data word, we can generate the parity bit, which ensures even parity.",
