# XOR CMOS Circuit 

## Components Required - 

* 4 PMOS
* 4 NMOS
* 1 VDD
* 1 GND

## Circuit Connections - 

* Drag the required PMOS, NMOS, VDD and GND components to the workspace
* Connect the circuit as shown in theory page with input1 considered as A and input2 considered as B and input1 complement as C and input2 complement as D
* After click on validate to observe the results


## Observations - 

* On clicking "validate" option after completing the circuit (assuming all connections are done correctly) you should see a table on the right side of the workspace
* By default, the inputs has been set to 1 change inputs to observe various results
